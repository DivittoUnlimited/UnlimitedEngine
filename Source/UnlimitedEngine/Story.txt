Wizard's Request:

Idea 1:
The story begins with a wizard greeting the player. He explains to the player how he has created this portal to their world and that he needs their help.
In, the wizard's world, a great hero was supposed to stop an evil power from estroying everything. Unfortunatily the hero they got was not so great and
he perished in his first battle. His troops say he tripped and fell off a cliff before the battle even started. Anyway, the wizard created this portal
to find the best person to take the place of the great hero and lead the people to victory against the great evil.

Idea 2:
The Wizard is in charge of finding lost artifacts throughout time. He has located a ring that gives the wearer the ability to control minds. The user
is currently abusing the rings power to take over the world in this dimension. Usually the Wizard would retrieve the item himself but because of the strange
nature of the item and the risk of an all powerfull wizard being turned to evil he has hired the player to find a way to get the ring and return it to the magical order.
