BUGS and ISSUES:
    - ConquestMode start battle crashes game.
    - Errors when attempting to connect to the server happen to often.
        - Clicking while "ERROR could not connect" is shown causes crash.
        - Server often can't be started more than once per session
        - Project must be cleaned every time the server is run for it to work again.
    - Units can be spawned on  top of spawn points
    - Top Row of tiles is "out - of - range" for mGrid

    - Fireblast will break when there is a target available.
        - Target can not be clicked...
        - Or is the mouse / grid not aligned?

    - Moving a unit makes HUD offset
        - need to update HUD during ( right after ) movement
        - Menu buttons get offset when camera moves.

FEATURES:
    - Random Map Generation:
        - make roads more randomly bendy (perlin noise?)

    - Wait options menu.
        - Currently just stubs
        - (will) Modify stats of unit that used the ability.
        

    - Gold ( Bonus points for Morale )
        - Player given points for total unit morale at the end of every turn
        - Player can use Gold to unlock/spawn new units. (think battlefront 2)
            - This slows what units can be spawned until they are earned in a match.
    - Spawn Points
        - Hide color under fog of war unless owned by player
        - How are they captured?
            - Unit capture abillity
                - Solution one: (Advanced wars) Units capture abillity based on HP some units can't capture at all
        - Fix Unit can be spawned on top of spawn point bug.
    - WifeBot        
        - build best path from owned spawn points to all other spawn points
            - Consider Offensive and defensive influence of the known world when building best path
                - use zone data
                - modify pathfinding heuristic to include influence
            - Boost the Importance of all the squares on the paths
        - Add AI Attacking spawn points
        - Add AI Spawning units
            - add currency first
        - Unit Tactics
            - Get list of all possible actions unit has
                - Each possible square it can move to
                - Each square it can attack or use ability on
                - Wait commad, choose stance.
                - use these options to call apropriate methods in grid class. (same player menu will call)
    - Fog of war
        - How will fog of war work in online games?
        - Fix server issues above first.
        - Solution 1: Make each player "Blue" locally, run fog of war locally.
        - Solution 2: (better) Match unit color with world->clientColor when updating fog of war

        - Team Tactics: (How the whole team should play.)
            - Apply AI Bias towards goals
                 - Some might be defensive others might go for buildings first etc...
            - Use pathfinding on zone grid to build list of objectives to capture all bases.
                 - an objective here is a zone along the best path to the next spawn point.
                 - Zone's overall tactical, offensive, and defensive scores should be affected by zones around them
            - Unit tactics: How each should play to support team tactics.
                 - based on goals build list of actions for units
                     - Move To
                     - Attack Square
                     - Heal
                     - Special Ability

    - Scouts should have invisibility mode even when exposed from fog of war.
    - Add Level of exp multplier to units
