BUGS and ISSUES:
    - ConquestMode start battle crashes game.
    - Errors when attempting to connect to the server happen to often.
        - Clicking while "ERROR could not connect" is shown causes crash.
        - Server often can't be started more than once per session
        - Project must be cleaned every time the server is run for it to work again.
    - Slow down unit movement "animation" proccess clicking the unit, selecting a square to move to etc...

FEATURES:
    - Fog of war
        - How will fog of war work in online games?
            - Fix server issues above first.
            - Solution 1: Make each player "Blue" locally, run fog of war locally.
            - Solution 2: (better) Match unit color with world->clientColor when updating fog of war
        - Hide building color if under fog of war
    - WifeBot
        - Add Zones
            - units should have importance
            - importance should radiate from origin
            - zones should be considered offensive or defensive goals with zone->importance - defensiveInfluence <= 0 as the best scenario
            - zones should be able to switch if they are offensive or defensive goals
            - zones with spawn points should always be considered highly important
            - if moving a unit out of a zone towards a new goal would cause the current zone to be incomplete, dont.
                - should add more units to the current zone before removing units to next objective
            - zones closer to units should emmit more importance to stop units from B-lining to spawn points

        - Add AI Attacking spawn points
        - Add AI Spawning units
            - add currency first

    - Game Currency
        - Morale
            - the in-game currency
            - Units should be given a morale bar below their health if morale falls to low they will stop fighting.
            - Player given points for total unit morale that can be used to spawn more units.
        - Player Exp
            - Level that goes up more when attacking then defending
            - Gain exp per morale points earned
            - Player can use exp points to unlock new units.

Notes:
    - WifeBot Overview:
        - Levels of "Thought":
            - Team Tactics: How the whole team should play.
               - Combine world data to generate mathematical representation of world state
               - Apply AI Bias towards goals
                    - Some might be defensive others might go for buildings first etc...
               - Use pathfinding on zone grid to build list of objectives to capture all bases.
                    - an objective here is a zone along the best path to the next spawn point.
                    - The heuristic for building this list of zones must include the zone's tactical
                      importance as well as both teams offensive and defensive influence in the zone
                    - Zone's overall tactical, offensive, and defensive scores should be affected by zones around them

               - Unit tactics: How each should play to support team tactics.

            - Tactical
            - Building influence
                - has spawn point or doesn't
            - Importance
    - Archers should get more range if they are on higher ground (i.e Standing on a wall)
    - Archers should have a posibilty of hitting adjacent squares to their target.(MISS)
    - Scouts should have invisibility mode even when exposed from fog of war.
    - Add Level of exp multplier to units
    - initiative per unit instead of turn based?
        - needs a lot more research!
    - Unit capture abillity
        - Solution one: (Advanced wars) Units capture abillity based on HP some units can't capture at all
