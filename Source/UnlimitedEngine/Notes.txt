BUGS and ISSUES:
    - ConquestMode start battle crashes game.
    - Errors when attempting to connect to the server happen to often.
        - Clicking while "ERROR could not connect" is shown causes crash.
        - Server often can't be started more than once per session
        - Project must be cleaned every time the server is run for it to work again.
        - Units can be spawned on  top of spawn points
        - Attack Squares are not showing up anymore
FEATURES:
    - New Attack/Ability Patterns
        - Replaces current system of using Grid::getTargets() -> Grid:::BuildPositions() etc...
        - Each unit will get there own attack pattens loaded from lua for easy modding
        - Create Child class of unit for each unit type.
        - Add virtual interface method to unit class UseAbility( Stat stat, vector2f range )
            - Enum of all possible unit stats that can be modified by abilities - health, defense, strength, dex etc..
            - range of randomly generated number to signify effectiveness of ability. (i.e Attack roll d4 + 2 etc.. )
        - Add ability tables to lua
            - name
            - Stat affected
            - Range
            - TargetSquare coordinates
        - load ability tables per unit in DataTables.hpp
        - Add action Menu when player clicks on a unit.
            - See Below

    - Action Menu
        - pops whenever you click a unit
        - pops for a unit after it has moved

        - This will simplify Grid::handleLeftClick()
            - Forced to break this up into seperate methods that the menu will be able to use.
            - How does this affect the AI?
                - Might have to write more commands for her to use this system...
                    - Select unit
                    - Get list of all possible actions unit has
                        - Each possible square it can move to
                        - Each square it can attack or use ability on
                        - Wait commad, choose stance.
                        - use these options to call apropriate methods in grid class. (same player menu will call)
        - TO-DO
            - Remove Current Attack system.
            - Mod handleLeftClick to only select units and buildings and then pop apropriate menu
            - Use menu to call methods such as attacks and moving from the grid.

    - Optional Wait option bonus menu
        - stance to take when you choose to wait?
            - Defensive
            - offensive
            - Ambush
            - Flee
            - Ready attack etc...
        - Boost morale when waiting

    - Fog of war
        - How will fog of war work in online games?
            - Fix server issues above first.
            - Solution 1: Make each player "Blue" locally, run fog of war locally.
            - Solution 2: (better) Match unit color with world->clientColor when updating fog of war
        - Hide building color if under fog of war
    - WifeBot        
        - build best path from owned spawn points to all other spawn points
            - Consider Offensive and defensive influence of the known world when building best path
                - use zone data
                - modify pathfinding heuristic to include influence
            - Boost the Importance of all the squares on the paths
        - Add AI Attacking spawn points
        - Add AI Spawning units
            - add currency first
    - Gold (Bonus points for Morale)
        - Player given points for total unit morale at the end of every turn
        - Player can use Gold to unlock new units. (think battlefront 2)
            - This slows what units can be spawned until they are earned in a match.
        - Used to purchase abilities for units after they level up enough to unlock them
ART:
    - Needed Maps:
        - (tutorial) Small street/alley
        - (Level1/Final level?) Main castle Gates Large map with tall walls, a gate to defend, and the
            - inner courtyard where most of the battle will take place.
        - (Level2) Grass plains outside of main castle. Mostly flat grass with some mud traps and sporatic mountains.
            - Their is a large trade road running through it.
    - Needed Sprites:
        - King portrait
        - SpawnPoint
    - Needed Tiles:
        - Castle walls
        - Castle floors
        - Grass
        - Coblestone road
        - dirt road
Notes:
    - Art:
        - Maps should be drawn like hand drawn maps in Dnd, GOT, LOTR, etc..
            - Gives excuse for simple art that looks cool
        - Low detail(tile art) large scale maps
        - High detail(tile art) smaller maps like dungeons etc...
    - Combat Algorith
        - D20's?
        - Risk?
        - both?
    - WifeBot Overview:
        - Team Tactics: (How the whole team should play.)
            - Combine world data to generate mathematical representation of world state
            - Apply AI Bias towards goals
                 - Some might be defensive others might go for buildings first etc...
            - Use pathfinding on zone grid to build list of objectives to capture all bases.
                 - an objective here is a zone along the best path to the next spawn point.
                 - The heuristic for building this list of zones must include the zone's tactical
                   importance as well as both teams offensive and defensive influence in the zone
                 - Zone's overall tactical, offensive, and defensive scores should be affected by zones around them
            - Unit tactics: How each should play to support team tactics.
                 - based on goals build list of actions for units
                     - Move To
                     - Attack Square
                     - Heal
                     - Special Ability
        - path finding: Moving around the grid.
        - Needed Data structures:
            - List of goals
                - Capture Spawn points
                - Defeat all enemy units
                - Capture signifigant locations
                - Capture zones
                - Defend zone
                - Spawn units
                - Generate funds
            - Grid data
        - Influence types:
            - Offensive
            - Defensive
            - Tactical
            - Importance
    - Archers should get more range if they are on higher ground (i.e Standing on a wall)
    - Archers should have a posibilty of hitting adjacent squares to their target.(MISS)
    - Scouts should have invisibility mode even when exposed from fog of war.
    - Add Level of exp multplier to units
    - Add skill tree for units to grow as they level up in battle.
        - Have more skills then skill slots (make player choose what to add)
        - limit ability use based on morale of the unit
        - Multiple paths per Unit?
            - Healing / Defense boost knights
            - Rogues with backstab or potions
            - Control bard / team buf bard
            - AOE Wizard / Direct fire Wizard
            - invisible scouts / fast scouts
            - strength boost fighter / morale boost fighter
    - initiative per unit instead of turn based?
        - needs a lot more research!
    - Unit capture abillity
        - Solution one: (Advanced wars) Units capture abillity based on HP some units can't capture at all
