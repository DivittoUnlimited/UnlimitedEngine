TO_DO LIST:
    - figure out why vs mode and multiplayer call Host game?
        - check main menu buttons
    - how does the pause state know to call a new menuState
        -or to pop battleState back to conquestOverviewState?
            - just leave Conquest state alive and make pause state remove itself and gamestate only
            - or use GAME_MODE
    - Make camera pan with mouse, as well as arrow keys
    - Setup "AI"'s turn in single player GameState
        - Solve 2 player over network first
            - use that system to abstract AI player
            - possibly break up world into single and multiplayer children versions that have own update and handle event
                - would then add new GameStates that call the various versions of world.
                    - player vs AI
                    - player vs player online
                    - player vs player couch coop
                    - AI vs AI
        - flesh out grid interface (simplify handleEvent) so that AI has the same options as player.
