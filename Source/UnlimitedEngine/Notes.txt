BUGS and ISSUES:
    - ConquestMode start battle crashes game.
    - Errors when attempting to connect to the server happen to often.
        - Clicking while "ERROR could not connect" is shown causes crash.
        - Server often can't be started more than once per session
        - Project must be cleaned every time the server is run for it to work again.
    - Units can be spawned on  top of spawn points
    - Dead units crash game when turn ends
    - That one unit is immortal....
FEATURES:
    - initiative system
        - first round init rolls based on speed
        - unit initiative will vary from there based on if it attacks or defends from attack, waits etc...
        - Units should display there turn order near their avatar
            - Small circle with number in it

    - Unit Abilities and menus
        - Use unit->mBeginingOfTurn to enact statMod effects in update method
            - create Abilities with longer duration statMods to test.
            - Must finish initiative system first
        - What happens when you use a waitMenu ability
            - Take Gaurd
                - boost morale and stamina
                - if unit should be attacked before next turn they will gain an oppertunity attack
                - Apply symbol to mark unit as taking guard on the map
            - Recover
                - Boost morale and stamina more than other wait menu Abilities
                - Show stat mod effects as they happed
            - Evade
                - If the unit gets attacked they have an opertunity to escape without being punished.
                - Apply symbol to indicate they are ready to run.

    - Gold (Bonus points for Morale)
        - Player given points for total unit morale at the end of every turn
        - Player can use Gold to unlock/spawn new units. (think battlefront 2)
            - This slows what units can be spawned until they are earned in a match.
        - must finish initiative system first to have correct "End of Turn"

    - Spawn Points
        - Hide color under fog of war unless owned by player
        - How are they captured?
            - Unit capture abillity
                - Solution one: (Advanced wars) Units capture abillity based on HP some units can't capture at all
        - How much gold should be awarded per spawn point per turn?
        - Fix Unit can be spawned on top of spawn point bug.

    - Add "Attack roll" vs Armour to see if attacks actually hit target.
        - Currently Armour does nothing becauase units just automaticly take damage (StatModifiers)

    - WifeBot        
        - build best path from owned spawn points to all other spawn points
            - Consider Offensive and defensive influence of the known world when building best path
                - use zone data
                - modify pathfinding heuristic to include influence
            - Boost the Importance of all the squares on the paths
        - Add AI Attacking spawn points
        - Add AI Spawning units
            - add currency first
        - Unit Tactics
            - Get list of all possible actions unit has
                - Each possible square it can move to
                - Each square it can attack or use ability on
                - Wait commad, choose stance.
                - use these options to call apropriate methods in grid class. (same player menu will call)
    - Fog of war
        - How will fog of war work in online games?
        - Fix server issues above first.
        - Solution 1: Make each player "Blue" locally, run fog of war locally.
        - Solution 2: (better) Match unit color with world->clientColor when updating fog of war
ART:
    - Needed Maps:

    - Needed Sprites:
        - Wizard Portrait
        - SpawnPoint
        - Attack damage animations
            - Slash for getting attacked
            - Particles for bleeding effects
            - Icons for other effects? broken sheild for less armour etc...
            - Icon for targted squares
            - Icons for each ability
            - Icons for Wait menu
                - for each button and to mark unit on map with added status

Notes:
    - Art:
        - Maps should be drawn like hand drawn maps in Dnd, GOT, LOTR, etc..
            - Gives excuse for simple art that looks cool
        - Low detail(tile art) large scale maps
        - High detail(tile art) smaller maps like dungeons etc...


    - WifeBot Overview:
        - Team Tactics: (How the whole team should play.)
            - Combine world data to generate mathematical representation of world state
            - Apply AI Bias towards goals
                 - Some might be defensive others might go for buildings first etc...
            - Use pathfinding on zone grid to build list of objectives to capture all bases.
                 - an objective here is a zone along the best path to the next spawn point.
                 - The heuristic for building this list of zones must include the zone's tactical
                   importance as well as both teams offensive and defensive influence in the zone
                 - Zone's overall tactical, offensive, and defensive scores should be affected by zones around them
            - Unit tactics: How each should play to support team tactics.
                 - based on goals build list of actions for units
                     - Move To
                     - Attack Square
                     - Heal
                     - Special Ability
        - path finding: Moving around the grid.
        - Needed Data structures:

                - Capture signifigant locations
                - Capture zones
                - Defend zone

        - Influence types:
            - Offensive
            - Defensive
            - Tactical

    - Archers should get more range if they are on higher ground (i.e Standing on a wall)
    - Archers should have a posibilty of hitting adjacent squares to their target.(MISS)
    - Scouts should have invisibility mode even when exposed from fog of war.
    - Add Level of exp multplier to units
