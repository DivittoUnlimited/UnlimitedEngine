TO_DO LIST:
    - Move states enum to be a lua table instead
    - figure out why vs mode and multiplayer call Host game?
        - check main menu buttons
    - how does the pause state know to call a new menuState
        -or to pop battleState back to conquestOverviewState?
            - just leave Conquest state alive and make pause state remove itself and gamestate only
            - or use GAME_MODE
    - Mouse should handle gui's as well.
    - If possible movement could go off grid the game will crash
    - Make camera pan with mouse
