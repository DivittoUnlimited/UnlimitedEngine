TO_DO LIST:
* change vector of flags per team to map of flags to make indexing them much easier!!!
* Research how the steering behaviors are actually rotating the ships.
* How do players communicate with each other and  the team logic?
* Fix all remaining starship id issues with category numbering system.
    - consider removing buildScene? - doubt it
* Give AI more access to info with insight methods:
    - FlagInRange, PlayerInRange, underAttack, hasFlag, healthLow, etc...
    - data from these methods should be communicated to team logic as well as other players.
* Break Arena into grid
    - starting positions
    - playbook positions (best spot for situation)
* team logic should include things like:
    - defend the flag holder,
    - defend location so other ship can capture flag,
    - target specific player to gain advantage etc...
* Should flags respawn or just disapear after capture?

GAME IDEAS:
Power up astroids
Turrets
    -team bullets
    -hurt everyone
Bumper Speed based on it's health
    health regens over time
Ships slow down when they get hit
    Health regens over time
stocks per team?
bullet radius bigger with charge up
bullet radius and damage smaller over time
Shooting energy bar that takes longer to regen if fully depleted
bigger bullets cost more energy
bullets auto fire when bullet has consumed all energy available to shoot
bar not shown but will be obvious in gameplay.
where/how to show health?
